        Sweetheart, I want you to know that I will live my entire life giving thanks to God for blessing me with someone as beautiful, caring, darling and loving as you are. I just want to believe that you’re meant for me just as I am for you alone. I feel honoured to have you in my heart and world. And I look forward to a better and beautiful tomorrow with you in my life. I love you so much more than you could ever imagine, my love.
    </p>

        I must be one lucky girl in this planet earth to have you in my life. You’re more than what I could have wished for in a woman. Because you possess so much more than I could have asked for. You’re really my heaven sent and I will live the rest of my life adoring, honouring and loving you with every breath in me. I love you to the moon and back, my princess. Sweet Words for Her to Make Her Smile
    </p>
